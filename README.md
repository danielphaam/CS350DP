# CS350DP


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
There were a total of three milestones in this course that revolved around TI's CC3220S microcontroller board. The first milestone focused on getting getting the user familiar with the LEDs and the third milestone focused on adding conditions to allow the LEDs on the board to be used as a form of communication. The thermostat project utilizes everything that we have learned from the previous milestones. The primary objectives of this Thermostat project was establishes a target temperature that is referred to as its 'set-point'. When the thermostat compares the temperature read from the sensor to the established set-point a decision is made. If the temperature is below the set-point, it turns the heater on. However, if the temperature is above the set-point, it turns the heater off.

What did you do particularly well?
One of the things that I did well was follow the directions provided on every milestone as well as the final project. Documenting and answering the technical questions regarding the project itself such as the functions and purposes of certain variables listed on the provided code template.

Where could you improve?
Milestone Two was difficult for me because i decided to follow the lab manual religiously. With the manual being outdated, the imported code template is significantly different than the directions on the lab manual. What I could have done better was learn how to "freestyle" the assignment a bit better and complete the assignment with the cards that I had been dealt.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I'm adding more experience to using both CCS, as well as experience in programming the microcontroller. Prior to this class, I had never used one before, so there was a lot of learning involved. This, along with other projects, will be useful to look back to at later dates.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Programming a microcontroller allowed me to realize that anything is possible if you know a bit about programming and a goal you would like to achieve. One of the components that I enjoyed was answering the technical questions at the end of each milestone and project. It made me realize that documentation is important to upholding coding best practices. Furthermore, I realize being able to answer the questions about the project has allowed me to learn new functions and coding aspects of programming.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Since much of the code in this project is imported from a template, it's self explanatory and easy to follow. I added a lot fo comments to explain lines of code, variables, functionality, etc., and kept it all logically put together. The while loop shows how each check of the timer works, and is easy to alter or build upon. It wouldn't take much work to add more tasks, alter times, adjust default values, etc.
